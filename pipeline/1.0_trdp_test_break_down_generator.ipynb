    "1. Break the paragraph down into **individual sentences** and convert them to the **singular tense**.\n",
    "    - Every subject, verb and complement must be converted into *singular tense**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each sentence do the following relevant information:\n",
    "    - Subject: Entity (vehicle, person, etc.) that performs the action described in the conclusion.\n",
    "    - Conclusion: The action that is present in the main sentence.\n",
    "    - Deontic Modality: Optional. The importance of the action indicated in the conclusion. Either, should/should not or must/must not, can/can not.\n",
    "    - Conditions: Things that have to be true, in order to the conclusion to be applicable.\n",
    "    - Syntactic structure: Sub-divide both conclusion and conditions in: subject, deontic modality (for conclusion only), action (verb), and complement (place, object, etc.). If conclusion or conditions are **None**, syntactic structure must be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Present the JSON with the extracted elements for each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON must have the following structure.\n",
    "- Every sentence will become a JSON object.\n",
    "- Every subject and verb and complement must be converted into *singular tense**\n",
    "- Each JSON object will have the \"source_text\" and the \"syntactic_structure\".\n",
    "- The \"source_text\" is the original sentence.\n",
    "- \"syntactic_structure\" contains the structure syntatic information for both conclusions and conditions, if any. That is, \"subject\", \"deontic\", \"verb\" and \"complement\".\n",
    "- If the subject is \"you\" replace by \"vehicle\".\n",
    "- If the verb relates to intent, such as \"wants\", \"will\", \"intends\", replace it with \"intends\".\n",
    "- If there is no explicit deontic operator, assume \"can\" if applicable.\n",
    "- Convert everything to **singular tense**.\n",
