# Mind the Gap

## Requirements

NetLogo: [https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/)

NetProLogo extension: [https://github.com/LyzardKing/NetProLogo](https://github.com/LyzardKing/NetProLogo)

## Usage

Load the file `Traffic Intersection.nlogo` in NetLogo.
It should pick up the Prolog file declared at the beginning.

The current version uses `traffic_rules_le.pl` which is mostly generated by LE.
